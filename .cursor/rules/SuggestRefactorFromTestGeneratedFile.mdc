        The file {{input}} was automatically generated based on a test file and may have minimal or redundant logic.
        Review the code and suggest refactoring improvements to enhance readability, maintainability, and domain consistency.
        Avoid changing any core business logic, but restructure code for clarity (e.g., extract methods, remove duplication, name cleanups).
        Provide a diff-style or inline suggestion format.
